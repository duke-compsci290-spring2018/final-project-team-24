            For our final project, we want to create an application similar to RateMyProfessor, but instead of rating professors, users would be rating specific Duke courses. There would be a main page that had the different departments at Duke, and then within the page for each department there would be references to specific course numbers. On the page for a specific course, any User could upload a review of the class that included information like overall enjoyment rating, difficulty rating, professor, semester, main assignments, overall thoughts, and suggestions for future students. Guests would be able to view this information but not upload new reviews and Administrators would be able to remove reviews that are unhelpful or unrelated and also edit the content of a review. At the top of the page there would be an average enjoyment rating and average difficulty rating for the class. You could also sort the reviews based on rating, date of upload, and professor. Users can also upvote or downvote specific reviews, adding to or diminishing from the credibility of a review. Once a review has 10 downvotes, it will be removed from the site. Additionally, if the course does not exist yet on the database or the department does not exist yet, users can create a new course or department page.

            This project would rely a lot on crowdsourcing data and active users submitting new reviews to the site. The application will be connected to a firebase database that will store information on users and ratings. We think this is an interesting application of what we have learned in Web Development, because something we have struggled with is deciding what classes we are interested in taking. Syllabi are not always available at registration time, so it would be helpful if Duke students could pool together their knowledge to create a place for students to learn more about what they will learn in a particular class and what the differences are when different professors teach the same class. RateMyProfessor lacks in this aspect, because many times a professor will have a review but not one that is relevant to the class that the student is interested in taking. Because of this, the reviews are not always helpful. Our website will allow students to search for information by class first before just jumping to the review of a certain professor.

            Our project is of an appropriate size, because it requires us to use firebase extensively and also requires us to use a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, and Vue which are all main concepts in the Web Development course. We also will be using data in multiple ways as we will be taking in data, displaying it in a user friendly way, and taking relevant statistics from it like average ratings. We will also have multiple types of users logging in that have different accessibility restrictions and preferences, thereby allowing us to learn more about validating users (i.e. checking that users have duke.edu email addresses). The project could also potentially use Duke resources for class numbers, names, or descriptions.
