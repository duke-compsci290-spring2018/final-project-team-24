        user login should go away when the user logs in  and when the user makes an account it should automatically log them in

        When I'm looking at a specific course, there is no way for me to go back to the course page, only the home page. 
        Also, the "Not you? Logout" button shows up even when I'm not logged in. Between the two levels of department buttons, you need some space. 
        They're on top of each other.
        When the user creates an account, there is no indication of whether or not the account creation was successful. 
        When someone logs in, their name should be displayed instead of their email.
        The creation of a new department is not intuitive. There should be a button to add it. 
        ^^ Ditto for the creating a new course
        I do like what happens when you create a department, you can see it instantly!
        Make the review boxes bigger by default
        Add a "Grade received box"
        "Update your review" shows up when you haven't written a review yet

        The up vote/down vote on the comments does not have a cap, so you can up vote/down vote as many times as you want, instead of letting each user only vote up/down once per comment. It did not allow me to create an account, or when I clicked create an account- all the fields cleared. unclear which was the problem but it doesn't work. Regarding the filter reviews section- it is unclear what you mean by "show this enjoyment" and "show this difficulty." Maybe instead have it like "filter difficulty high to low" or "low to high" sort of like when you are online shopping. Also, when i try to log in nothing happens- it doesn't tell me if i got the wrong password or don't have an account.
